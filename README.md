Introduction
The healthcare industry is on the brink of a digital revolution, and technologies like FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) are at the forefront of this change. Coupled with the power of modern AI and machine learning models such as GPT-4, Llama2, and BERT, there are infinite possibilities to explore. This repository is a humble effort to consolidate and share knowledge in these domains through interactive Jupyter notebooks.

### Notebooks Overview
Clinical Decision Support (CDS): Understand the systems that assist in clinical decision-making tasks by providing evidence-based recommendations.

- FHIR: Dive deep into Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, which is a standard for health care data exchange.
- GPT-4: Explore the capabilities of GPT-4, OpenAI's state-of-the-art language model.
- Embeddings + Vector Search
- Llama2: Get to know Llama2, yet another fascinating model in the world of AI.
- BERT & Transformers: Understand the world of BERT and Transformer models which have revolutionized the NLP domain.
- Hugging Face: Explore the tools and libraries provided by Hugging Face, a leading company in the NLP domain.
- Fast AI
- Langchain

... and many more!
